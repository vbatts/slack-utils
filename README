TODO: 
* revise slack-utils, to use the Slackware module
* add methods to pretty_print, so that the collectors can be separated
* 2010-08-20 09:16 <bailey> which is that I need to run a query to show
	me what packages I'm running are different than the slack-current
	versions, since I make local ones and forget about it
* enable `slf` to a relative path, and it determine the absolute path
